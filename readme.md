## No more updates.

I'm not going to code for dota 2 anymore.
This game is crap, I can't win even with cheats. Fuck this game.

p.s. I can update scripts to fix critical errors and nothing more.

### BETA!!!

Reload script if some meepo is inactive. It happens if you spawn one with aghanim and in some rare situations.

### Options

[Meepo bot] -> [Control Hero] - enable to force meepo-bot to control your hero also.


### Meepo-bot

[![Meepo-bot](http://i.imgur.com/EFds4TF.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMVhPQ7tJyE "Meepo-bot")

Well, this meepo-bot can do a list of things:

1) Auto-save if has less than 15% hp.

1.1) The amount of HP is raised to 35% if enemy hero is close.



2) Auto-farm forest

2.1) Switch farm spots to easy if level is small.

2.2) Switch farm spots to medium and strong if level is acceptable.

2.3) The amount of HP is raised to 45% if enemy hero is close.

2.4) Poof to farm faster, but not wasting all mana. Saving 50% always.

2.5) Blacklists farmed camps and cleans blacklist every minute.



3) Line of sight attack

3.1) Bot will attack enemies he can see while moving to his destination.

3.2) Attacks enemy heroes and auto-nets them. And auto-puffs.



4) Decision mechs:

4.1) He decides what to do.

4.2) He decides to run away or to help in killing enemy hero and etc.

4.3) If he decides that some spot is dangerous he will go away (and return a little bit later).


## UPDATED

1) Meepo uses travel boots or poof to move at base faster.

2) Fixed a little danger-meter.

3) "TEAMFIGHT" mode.

4) Updated "LOS" mode (Line of sight), now meepo focuses buildings too!
